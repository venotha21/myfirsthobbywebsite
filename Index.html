<center><p><strong>My name is Venotha.</strong>
<br>I am originally from Srilanka. 
<br>However, I was born and brought up in Denmark. 
<br>I moved to United Kingdom back in 2011, where 
<br>I did my degree in software engineering. 

<br>My hobbies are travelling, dancing, reading, 
<br>journal writting and watching movies.</p>
<br>I enjoy all my hobbies, however travelling is a very personal and enriching experience, 
<br>and every journey is so unique. I have been to a bunch of 
<br>countries already and would love to explore more in the future. 
<br>This website will take you onboard on my travel journey that I have 
<br>already taken plus the ones I will be taking in the future. </center>
